## Introduction

**nf-core/bacmodel** is a bioinformatics pipeline for comprehensive functional annotation and metabolic modeling of bacterial genomes. The pipeline takes bacterial genome assemblies (FASTA format) and performs structural annotation using Prokka or Bakta, followed by functional characterization using specialized tools for macromolecular system detection (MacSyFinder), phenotype prediction (Traitar), and metabolic model reconstruction (CarveMe and gapseq). It produces a complete picture of genomic potential, functional capabilities, and predicted metabolic pathways.

![nf-core/bacmodel metro map](docs/images/nf-core-bacmodel_metro_map.svg)

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

1. Genome annotation with [Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) or [Bakta](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta)
2. Macromolecular system detection with [MacSyFinder](https://github.com/gem-pasteur/macsyfinder) (optional)
3. Phenotype prediction with [Traitar](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/traitar) (optional)
4. Metabolic model reconstruction with [CarveMe](https://github.com/cdanielmachado/carveme) or [gapseq](https://github.com/jotech/gapseq) (optional)
5. Model quality evaluation with [MEMOTE](https://github.com/opencobra/memote) (optional)

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/get_started/environment_setup/overview) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/get_started/run-your-first-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows. It can be comma-separated (`.csv`) or tab-separated (`.tsv`):

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fasta
sample1,/path/to/genome1.fasta
sample2,/path/to/genome2.fasta.gz
sample3,https://example.com/genome3.fasta.gz
```

Each row represents a bacterial genome assembly. The `fasta` column can contain:

- Local file paths (absolute or relative)
- URLs to remote FASTA files
- the files can be in gzipped or in uncompressed FASTA format

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/bacmodel \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

By default, the pipeline runs Prokka annotation. To use Bakta instead:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/bacmodel \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --annotation_tool bakta \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

To enable optional functional analysis tools:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/bacmodel \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --skip_macsyfinder false \
   --skip_traitar false \
   --skip_carveme false \
   --skip_gapseq false \
   --skip_memote false \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/run-pipelines#using-parameter-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/bacmodel/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/bacmodel/parameters).
